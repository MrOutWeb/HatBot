# Reporting an issue / Feature request
You are more than welcome to submit issues through the issues tracker, but please provide as much details as possible when doing so:

- Command invoked
- Channel in which the command was invoked
- What happened (or didn't happen)
- What should have happened (or shouldn't have happened)

If you feel comfortable, a link to the Discord message would help greatly (you can always send them to me in a Discord DM, with a link to the issue if possible).

# Submitting a pull request
Please submit changes to the `dev` branch. If possible, please try to respect the [PEP 8 coding style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008). Existing code can be converted to PEP 8 compliant code with the following command:

```autopep8 -i -a --hang-closing file.py```
